1) One observation I made when analyzing this data set was that there is an obvious difference in student performance across all subjets between those who
   attended Charter schools vs. District schools. Both math and reading scores are noticeably higher in Charter schools compared to District schools.
   
2) Another observation I made is that both math and reading scores remained generally stable across student's grade years. Grade year had very little
   impact on the reading and math scores of students.
